It features demand forecasting, safety stock controls, and integration with bundle products. The intuitive interface and reliable performance ensure accurate data management, while exceptional customer support is noted for its responsiveness and effective personalized onboarding.\nShow more\nFebruary 5, 2026\nAssisty has become a core part of our inventory management stack on Shopify.\nThe app works flawlessly and provides a very clear, reliable, and deep view of inventory performance across products, variants, and collections. Beyond basic stock tracking, Assisty delivers a rich set of insights that actually help you manage inventory, not just monitor it. Forecasting, stock health indicators, sell-through analysis, and visual breakdowns are all there and extremely easy to work with. What really stands out is that it covers everything you need for day-to-day inventory decisions and then goes several steps further with advanced analytics that are usually missing from Shopify by default. The UI is intuitive, the data is accurate, and the app feels built for real operational use, not just reporting. For any Shopify store with a medium to large catalog, Assisty is a must-have tool. It saves time, reduces mistakes, and enables much smarter inventory and commercial decisions.\nShow more\nFemina\nIsrael\n5 months using the app\nJanuary 21, 2026\nI have major inventory issues and based on my experience with Assisty so far (1 week) I think Assisty is the solution.

Know The Product Demand\nWhen you open a new eCommerce store, you must know how your product demand fluctuates throughout the year. It’s essential to get a better idea about your potential sales each month.\nLet's say you have a store that sells snowboards.\nYou can head over to Google Trends and see how the search traffic for the word snowboard fluctuates.\nTo get more accurate data, you can select Category as Sports and Change Web search to Google Shopping.\nHere’s what we got for the past 12 months when we ran a search for the term\n‘snowboard.’\nThe above graph shows that there are good chances that you might not have many sales from March to August.\nSo based on these projections, you can plan how to devise your\nShopify\ninventory management strategy.\n02. Forecast Future Sales Projections\nIf you have a sales history, you can simply go through it and know which month is the most profitable for you.\nYou can also look for events/holidays where you make more sales comparably.\nDoing this will let you order and stock products in your inventory before peak sales. This way, you won’t be out of stock and lose potential customers when you need them the most.\nIf your store’s new, you can refer to the Google Trends method mentioned above.\n03. Set Minimum Stock Levels\nA minimum stock level is a threshold value of your inventory. You shouldn’t allow the stocks in your store to fall below this value.\nNote:\nWhen it comes to inventory management, any eCommerce store’s goal is to know the lowest possible inventory they could keep to fulfill their customers’ needs without delays.\nTo have a strong inventory management system, you must know the time it takes to replenish your inventory once the products dip below the minimum stock levels.\n04. Prioritize Products With ABC Analysis\nWith ABC analysis, you can prioritize the existing inventory using three categories:\nA:\nHigh-value products with low sales frequency\nB:\nModerate-value products with moderate sales frequency\nC:\nLow-value products with high sales frequency\nHere’s a graph to understand ABC analysis better:\nABC analysis is based on the Pareto Principle i.e. 80% of products are bought by 20% of customers. These customers buy the products that fall into category A.\nYou don’t want to lose product A customers as they’re your major source of revenue.\nTherefore to have a leak-proof inventory management system, you must know which products need the most attention (A) and which ones the least.\nNow that you know what inventory management is and how to build a proper system let’s look at some apps that will help you with inventory management for your\nShopify store.\nBonus Tips for Shopify Inventory Management\nWhether you’re a new Shopify business owner or building your second store on this platform, always keep the following Shopify inventory management tips in mind:\nCategorize Your Inventory\nPrioritizing products in groups can help you know which products need to be ordered frequently and how slowly they are being removed from your inventory.\nThis allows you to focus on profitable products. In order to improve your inventory, consider dividing that into multiple groups based on profitability and turnover. Start with three:\nFirst Group:\nFast-selling products with a low price tag\nSecond Group:\nMedium-selling products with a medium price tag\nThird Group:\nSlow-selling products with a high price tag\nKeep Updating Inventory Records In Real-time\nKeep product information records of all items in the inventory. Access to the latest and correct inventory data is the key to moving products quickly and efficiently. You need to record information like barcodes, SKUs, suppliers, and so on. In addition, know when the last transaction occurred.\nAudit Inventory Regularly\nReal-time tracking makes it very easy to audit your inventory on a regular basis. Many people audit inventory once a year, while others may conduct random checks on their products monthly or weekly.\nIn any case, run audits to ensure the accuracy between financial records and stock quantity. This will assist you to know your inventory flow, profit as well as loss, and keep your inventory working smoothly.\nPrefer Customer Satisfaction\nYour goal should be to avoid useless content in the inventory. However, blindly lowering stock levels from inventory will decrease your focus on the most critical element in the Shopify business: customer satisfaction.\nIn case your inventory is not so good and customers don't buy your products, you will obviously lose sales. So, try to make your inventory in such a way your customers want it to be.\nWhat To Look For In An Inventory Management System\nThere are a multitude of inventory management apps in the Shopify store. But although they aim to improve your inventory tracking, they all have their differences.\nBasically, you need to choose one that suits you best. Be that as it may, there are a few, non-negotiable features that need to be present in your inventory management:\nIntegration With Current Apps\nBefore committing to a Shopify inventory management system, make sure that it can be integrated with your other systems, especially your sales channels, to attain a seamless workflow.\nStreamline & Automate Processes\nInventory management apps aim to automate stocking processes to eliminate tedious manual management. Make sure that the Shopify inventory system that you choose provides your needed automations to help you save time and money in the long run.\nPOS Integration\nIf you are using Shopify POS on your retail stores, you need to ensure that your Shopify inventory management app can be integrated with it so you can accurately reconcile your online and in-store sales.\nAccurate Analysis\nAmong the main functions of Shopify stock management apps are sales analytics that are more detailed than what you can find in your Shopify admin. This gives you reports as regards your best selling and least selling products, as well as your profit margin for each, and more.\nSales Prediction\nYou might want to opt for a Shopify inventory management app with sales prediction capabilities if you want to optimize your inventory levels so your supply chain can run like a well-oiled machine without sacrificing your cash flow. Not all apps have this function though. So choose wisely.\nConclusion\nAs shown in our list, Shopify inventory management apps come in a wide range of prices. There are inexpensive ones, and there are also those that require more than a thousand-dollar monthly premium.\nBasically, the inexpensive ones can be used by small to growing businesses while those at the higher end of the spectrum are recommended for use by enterprises with complex inventory and logistics needs – especially those with several warehouse locations, and employing an omni-channel sales approach.\nIf you are just starting out in your business, the built-in inventory level management system in the Shopify admin works really great and we suggest maximizing it.\nBut as soon as your needs grow more complex and demanding, that’s the time that you should consider one of these apps.\nShopify  Inventory  Management FAQ\nIs there inventory management in Shopify?\nYes,\nShopify\ncomes with a built-in inventory management system for retailers. However, if the built-in inventory system is not sufficient, there’s a wide range of inventory management apps available in the\nShopify app store\n.

For example, if the previous inventory count in the `available` state is 100, and you want to change it to 102, then the given delta (difference) is 2.\n\n* The `inventorySetQuantities` mutation explicitly sets the quantity of inventory in the `on_hand` or `available` state to the given value.\n\n* The inventoryMoveQuantities mutation moves a quantity of inventory between the `available` state and the `reserved`, `damaged`, `safety_stock`, and `quality_control` states, or between unavailable states (`reserved`, `damaged`, `safety_stock`, and `quality_control`). For example, 100 units of inventory can be moved from the `reserved` state to the `available` state.\n\n---", "source_domain": "shopify.dev", "content": "Apps in inventory management\nSkip to main content\nApps\nStorefronts\nAgents\nReferences\nAsk assistant\n/\nHelp\n•\nLog in\nApps\nBuild\nDesign\nLaunch\nCollapse sidebar\nGetting started\nShopify app platform\nApp surfaces\nScaffold an app\nBuild an app\nDev tools\nDev MCP server\nShopify CLI for apps\nDev Dashboard\nExtending Shopify\nAdmin\nCheckout\nCustomer accounts\nFlow\nOnline store\nPoint of Sale\nSidekick\nBuilding blocks\nGraph\nQL\nExtensions\nShopify Functions\nShopify\nQL\nStorefront MCP\nWebhooks\nMetafields\nMetaobjects\nAuthentication\nUse cases\nMarketing and analytics\nDiscounts\nProduct merchandising\nPurchase options\nGlobal markets\nOrders and fulfillment\nPayments\nSales channels\nB2B\nShopify Collective\nBlockchain\nBest practices\nPerformance\nAccessibility\nLocalize your app\nIntegrating with Shopify\nMobile support\nNon-deceptive code\nCompliance\nSecurity\nFull index\nExpand\nOn this page\nHow it works\nInventory states\nUse cases\nWebhooks\nDeveloper tools and resources\nLimitations\nNext steps\nApps in inventory management\nAsk assistant\nInventory management apps provide merchants with various ways to manage their inventory. For example, an inventory management app might query and adjust inventory quantities on behalf of a merchant.\nThis guide describes the inventory management lifecycle, provides use cases for inventory management apps, and offers some developer tools and resources to get you started.\nAnchor to How it works\nHow it works\nInventory is the set of items that a merchant tracks and uses to conduct their business. This can include items that are physically at a location and ready to be sold, items that are incoming to a merchant's location, and items that are set aside for holds or inspection.\nMerchants track inventory to avoid selling products that have run out of stock, and determine when they need to order or make more of a product. Apps and third-party logistics providers can automate the\ninventory management process\nby querying and adjusting inventory quantities on behalf of merchants.\nThe following diagram shows some of the inventory management activities that an app or third-party logistics provider can perform in the context of an order lifecycle:\nCustomers\nplace and receive orders that contain product variants.\nShopify\ndecrements the available inventory quantity for product variants that are included in an order, and increments the committed inventory quantity for the order. After the order is fulfilled, Shopify decrements the committed inventory quantity.\nApps or third-party logistics providers\nautomate the inventory management process by querying inventory quantities at one or more locations, managing inventory quantities, and moving inventory quantities between states.\nMerchants or third-party fulfillment services\ntrack inventory in the Shopify admin and fulfill orders.\nAnchor to Inventory states\nInventory states\nAn inventory state represents the quantities of a product at a specific location or quantities that have been committed to orders. Inventory is grouped into different states:\nInventory state\nDescription\nincoming\nThe inventory that's on its way to a merchant's location. For example, the inventory might be in an incoming shipment. Incoming inventory isn't available to sell until it has been received and its state has been changed to\navailable\n.\nThe\nincoming\nstate is the only state that represents quantities that aren't physically present at a location. Incoming inventory is surfaced at its destination location.\non_hand\nThe total number of units that are physically at a location.\nThe\non_hand\nstate equals the sum of inventory quantities that are in the\navailable\n,\ncommitted\n,\nreserved\n,\ndamaged\n,\nsafety_stock\n, and\nquality_control\nstates.\navailable\nThe inventory that a merchant can sell. Available inventory isn't committed to any orders and isn't part of incoming transfers.\ncommitted\nThe number of units that are part of a placed order but aren't fulfilled.

We don’t have a huge product catalog (around 50 products), but each product has a lot of variants, usually 10+ (different materials and sizes).\nA couple of things that make it tricky:\nSome products share the same inventory (e.g. same material/stock but different listings).\nI want something that makes it easier to track low stock items.\nIdeally, I’d love if it could also give me suggestions or alerts for when to restock.\nWe only use Shopify (no external integrations like Amazon/eBay), so I’m looking for apps or tools that work smoothly within Shopify.\nHas anyone dealt with a similar setup? Which app(s) would you recommend?\nThanks in advance\nAiTrillion\nSeptember 16, 2025,  5:33pm\n2\nHello\n@Chloe_M\n,\nI hope you are doing well!\nPlease check the below apps\n1.)\nQuick books online\n2.)\nStocky by Shopify\nI recommend taking a demo with the app developer before purchasing.

After they deprecated some of the most useful features, it just stopped being worth the time and effort.\napp-dev\nOctober 26, 2025, 10:27pm\n6\nI’ve dealt with almost this exact setup — small catalog but lots of variants that share the same materials. Keeping tabs on what’s running low can get messy fast.\nShopify’s default inventory tools are fine for basic tracking, but they don’t really alert you until you go looking for the problem.\nThat’s what led me to build\nElevix: Low Stock Alert\n— a small app that checks your products once a day and sends a simple email summary of anything below your chosen stock threshold (e.g., “alert me if <10 left”). It’s built to work entirely inside Shopify, no integrations needed.\nIt won’t forecast restocks yet, but it solves the “I missed that this variant sold out” problem that used to drive me crazy.\nEasify-Jennifer\nNovember 19, 2025,  7:19am\n7\nHi\n@Chloe_M\nYou can handle this scenario easily using\nEasify Inventory Sync\n. If you have multiple products that share the same stock, the key is to create an\nInventory Group\n. This allows you to link products that draw from the same pool of inventory, so you don’t have to manually adjust stock for each individual item.\nOnce products A and B are assigned to the same group and set to use\nmutual inventory\n, the system automatically keeps track of their shared stock.\nFor example, if a customer purchases product A, the shared inventory is reduced accordingly. This means product B’s available stock will also decrease in real-time, reflecting the updated quantity.\nThis setup ensures that your stock levels are always accurate, avoids overselling, and simplifies inventory management across multiple products that rely on the same inventory.\nThis app is very beginner-friendly, I hope you will try it. If you need any further assistance setting this up, please let me know or reach out to Easify!\nLeena_1994\nNovember 19, 2025, 12:54pm\n8\nHi\n@Chloe_M\n,\nI understand your requirements, and for your use case I would recommend using\nInventory Sync Gogo\napp. With this app, you can create an inventory group for your duplicate products. Whenever an order is placed for any item within that group—or if you manually update the inventory of one product—the app will automatically update the inventory of all other products in the group in real time based on the latest change (delta).\nThe app also includes a\nWelcome Plan\n, which makes it easy for you to test everything without any pressure. Support team is very responsive and always happy to help you set things up or answer any questions you may have.\nBadMatter\nNovember 23, 2025,  1:26am\n9\nHi\n@Chloe_M\n,\nI just came across your post and noticed exactly the problems you are describing: multiple listings drawing from the same physical stock (shared inventory) and the need for reliable restock alerts.\nThis is actually a two-part problem, and standard inventory apps often struggle with the first part (the “shared” aspect).\nI am Johannes from P&H Cloud Solutions, and we built a specific setup for exactly this scenario that is much more affordable than the big ERP systems:\n1. Solving the “Shared Inventory” (The sync issue)\nYou need a Bill of Materials (BOM) tool. Our app\nAssemblified\nallows you to link your different listings (e.g., Product A and Product B) to the same underlying “Material” or “Base Stock”.\nWhen you sell one listing, Assemblified automatically updates the stock for the material and all other linked listings instantly.\nIt starts at just\n$6/month\n.\n2. Solving the “Restock Suggestions” (The planning issue)\nOnce your stock is accurate via Assemblified, you need to know\nwhen\nto reorder. That’s where our other app,\nLogistified\n, comes in.\nIt integrates directly with Assemblified to read your true material demand.\nIt provides AI-powered stockout forecasts and sends you email alerts/reports when you need to reorder.\nThis one starts at\n$12/month\n.\nSo for\n$18/month total\n, you would cover both the complex syncing of shared stock and the intelligent forecasting/alerting. Most competitors charge significantly more for just one of these features.\nBoth apps have a free trial, so you can test if the “shared inventory” setup works for your specific listings without any risk.\nHope this helps you get your inventory sorted!\nBest regards, Johannes P&H Cloud Solutions UG\nwebgility_hq\nDecember 1, 2025,  2:27pm\n10\nFor setups with lots of variants and shared inventory pools, you’ll want a tool that gives you clear visibility into stock levels and accurate tracking across linked variants.\nStocky (if you’re using Shopify POS Pro) and Trunk (great for bundles or duplicate SKUs) both offer real-time sync and low-stock alerts. If you eventually expand into multi-channel selling, Webgility can help centralize inventory and forecasting, but for a Shopify-only workflow, a lightweight, native app should work well.\nLeena_1994\nDecember 2, 2025,  8:35am\n11\nHi\n@Chloe_M\n,\nSorry for the late reply. I completely understand your situation — I was dealing with the exact same issue a few months ago and even raised this question in the community myself. That’s when someone recommended the\n“\nInventory Sync Gogo\n”\napp, and honestly, it turned out to be a game-changer.\nThe app is extremely easy to set up, with a simple one-click configuration. It automatically syncs inventory across duplicate products. So in your scenario, when an order is placed for any Product, the app identifies other duplicate products using the same SKU and instantly updates their stock levels to reflect the latest change in real time.\nThis keeps all listings that share the same SKU perfectly synchronized and always up to date.\nThey also offer a\nWelcome Plan\n, which allows you to try out the app comfortably without any pressure. On top of that, their support team is very responsive and always ready to assist with setup or answer any questions you might have.\n1 Like\nwebgility_hq\nJanuary 19, 2026,  8:02am\n12\nHey\n@Chloe_M\nIf your main goal is shared inventory logic or forecasting, there are many Shopify-native inventory apps that focus more on bundles, components, and restock planning.\nBefore recommending you the perfect fit, may I know which accounting platform you’re using to keeps you book organized for your business?\nOlllie\nJanuary 20, 2026,  6:13pm\n13\nI’ve recently launched\nautoStockist\n, a Shopify app that helps keep track of low-stock and out-of-stock products.\nIt sends instant email alerts when items reach your chosen stock levels, with thresholds set per product or collection, and also notifies you when something sells out. If you’d rather avoid lots of individual emails, you can switch to daily or weekly summary alerts instead.\nThere’s also a dashboard showing everything that’s currently low or out of stock, plus some early trend insights around sell-through rates and suggested restock amounts (those predictive features are still in beta).\nIf that sounds useful, feel free to check it out.

A well-optimized Shopify inventory management system ensures seamless stock control, efficient order fulfillment, and enhanced customer satisfaction. Conversely, poor inventory management can lead to overstocking, higher storage costs, fulfillment delays, and revenue loss, ultimately impacting business growth.\nFor Shopify store owners, leveraging a well-structured inventory management system ensures real-time stock tracking, prevents overselling, and streamlines the order fulfillment process.

It helps you track product availability, manage stock quantities, and synchronize inventory across all your sales channels, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in your operations.\nManage inventory on Shopify\nWhen you add a product to your Shopify store, you can specify inventory details such as the initial stock level, SKU (stock-keeping unit), and whether the product should continue selling when out of stock. Shopify keeps track of every product's inventory level in real-time. Therefore, when a customer places an order, the system automatically reduces the available quantity, reflecting the changes immediately in your store’s inventory.\nFor multi-channel sellers, Shopify allows inventory synchronization across platforms like Amazon, eBay, or social media storefronts. When a product sells on one platform, Shopify updates the inventory on all connected channels, preventing overselling or stock discrepancies. This feature saves time and reduces the risk of customer dissatisfaction.\nShopify sync products\nShopify also provides powerful reporting tools to help you analyze your inventory. You can access reports showing best-selling products, inventory turnover rates, and items that need replenishing. These insights allow you to make informed decisions about restocking and forecasting demand.\nDiscover more about Shopify with our resources below:\nShopify Review: Is Shopify The Crown Jewel of The eCommerce World?\nTop 10 Best Shopify Themes – Have You Got One?\nShopify Tutorial: 9 Complete Steps to Get Instant Sales\nBenefits of Shopify inventory management\nShopify inventory management offers numerous benefits that streamline your business operations and enhance customer satisfaction. Its intuitive tools help you save time, reduce errors, and improve stock control across all sales channels.\nReal-time inventory tracking: Shopify automatically updates stock levels whenever an order is placed or inventory is restocked. This ensures accurate data and prevents stockouts or overselling.\nManagement of product variants: Easily track inventory for different sizes, colors, or custom options. This is ideal for businesses with diverse or complex product catalogs.\nSeamless multi-channel integration: Sync inventory across platforms like Amazon, eBay, and social media storefronts. This eliminates mismatched stock levels and reduces the need for manual updates.\nInventory reporting and analytics: Access detailed reports to identify best-selling products, monitor low-stock items, and analyze trends. Use this data to make informed decisions about restocking and marketing strategies.\nBy utilizing these features, Shopify inventory management enables you to save time, reduce errors, and focus on growing your business efficiently.\nChallenges when managing Shopify inventory\nWhile Shopify inventory management offers powerful tools, there are challenges that businesses may encounter. Understanding these issues can help you address them effectively and maintain smooth inventory operations.\nHandling large inventories manually: Businesses with extensive product catalogs may find it time-consuming to update stock levels, manage product variants, or process bulk changes without automation.\nLimited multi-location support for complex setups: Although Shopify allows inventory tracking across multiple locations, businesses with intricate warehouse systems or global operations may find the built-in features insufficient without third-party apps.\nStock syncing delays in multi-channel setups: When selling on multiple platforms, there is a risk of syncing delays, leading to mismatched stock levels. This can result in overselling or unhappy customers.\nDependency on third-party apps: For advanced inventory management features, many businesses rely on external apps. This can add extra costs and require additional setup and maintenance.\nBy identifying these challenges, you can explore strategies or tools to address them, such as automation apps, integrations, or tailored workflows. This ensures you get the most out of Shopify inventory management while avoiding potential setbacks.\nHow to Manage Shopify Inventory Management\nWith all of the factors discussed above, we hope that you get a better overview of how important Shopify inventory management is. In the next section, we’ll show you how to control the stock level of your store easily.\nWithout further ado, let’s get going!\n1. Keep track of inventory\nTo make changes to the inventory of your Shopify store, the first step you need to do is set up inventory tracking for all of your items or just a few products. Once activating this option, you’ll be able to view a 90-day inventory history.\nTo do so, please navigate to “Products” > “All products” from your Shopify Admin. Then, select the name of the item as well as the variant you want to track.\nShopify products\nNext, go to the “Inventory” section and select “Track quantity”. By default, your customers can’t make an order if the product they want to buy is out-of-stock until its quantity is updated to be greater than one. However, you can tick on the “Continue selling when out of stock” box in case that item is available for pre-order or the stocks are on the way to your location.\nShopify products\nNext, enter the number of stocks in the “Quantity” section and click “Save” to finish setting up.\n2. Adjust the quantities of inventory\nBasically, Shopify allows you to make changes to the available quantity and the inventory quantity.\nAvailable quantity\nTo edit the number of available quantities of a single variant, simply enter the quantity you want to adjust in the “Edit quantity available” bar.\nIn case you want to set a specific quantity for multiple variants, you'll need to select the variant you want to edit first. Then, expand the “More action” section and click on “Update quantity”.\nAdjust available quantity\nInventory quantity\nTo modify the inventory quantity, all you need to do is click on the “Add” button and then enter a specific number.\nBesides, Shopify allows you to set a new total inventory quantity by selecting “Set” and providing a number you want.\n3. Import/Export inventory data from CSV files\nAs a Shopify user, you can freely import and export CSV files of your inventory quantity of a specific location or across all locations (if any). After downloading the CSV files, you’ll be able to grab an overview of product information including identifies, variants, and quantities.\nTo export inventory, navigate to “Products” > “Inventory”. Next, click “Export” and select the rows that you want to export. After that, choose “Export inventory” and you’re done.\nShopify export inventory\nTo import your existing files to Shopify, select “Import” instead of “Export” after going to the Inventory section. Then, click “Import inventory” and press on “Start import” button after verifying what data you want to import.\nImport CSV file\nThe bad news is, your CSV file format might not be compatible with Shopify due to the lack of specific information that you can’t find out. If this is the case, the LitExtension data migration service would benefit you in many ways.\nBesides transferring entities from platform to platform, LitExtension gets the name on the scoresheet by providing CSV Files Migration Service. Especially, the CSV files import/export will be completed by our experts because it’s quite sophisticated. Hence, all you need to do is provide your store credentials and wait for the process to be finished without any concerns.\nSeamlessly migrate your store to Shopify with ease!\nLitExtension can safely transfer your data to unlock more growth on the new Shopify store.\nFREE DEMO NOW\n4. Manage transfers from suppliers\nBy managing transfers from suppliers, you’ll find it easier to keep track of and receive incoming stock delivery from them.\nStep 1: Once you fill in your inventory from supplier delivery, Shopify will immediately update the quantities of items for you. However, you need to enable Shopify’s inventory tracking that we instruct in the section above to make this process automatically.\nInventory management\nStep 2: To create a transfer, you need to submit a purchase order to a specific supplier and then receive a confirmation.\nFirst, navigate to Products > Transfers from your Shopify admin. Next, click on Add transfer > optionally add a supplier by choosing Select origin from the ORIGIN section if you already have several suppliers, or add a new one by selecting Create new supplier and enter their name as well as other information.\nManage transfer from suppliers\nTo continue, you need to enter a date in the Expected arrival bar after moving to the Shipment section.\nNext, provide the name of the product, variant, quantities and other additional details. Finally, click Add to transfer to create a transfer to a supplier.\n5. ABC inventory analysis\nNot every product in your store is the best-selling item. There are some products that generate lots of sales for your business. On the other hand, there might be items that rarely receive orders and might put your advertising cost to waste.\nIf that’s the case, try Shopify ABC inventory analysis. This function categorizes your products into three simple groups based on their sales, including:\nA-grade: These are your top-selling products. They account for 80% of your total revenue.\nB-grade: These products make up 15% of the total store revenue.

Obviously, you need item quantities to be spot-on for subsequent value calculations to be reliable.\n\nWe include a smartphone app that makes stocktakes easier and less error prone, e.g. you can quickly scan barcodes with the phone’s built-in camera, no additional hardware required. You can even invite other smarthphone-wielding users to help with the inventory count.\n\nThe Cohub Inventory Admin on Shopify provides total inventory values by location so you should be able to compare those numbers with what you see in QuickBooks.\n\nAnd, we'll soon release our *Time Travel* feature that lets you see inventory values on any given day in the past, useful for tracking down where things may have gotten off track. I bet your financial folks and accountant will appreciate that.\n\nHere’s a quick video overview of how it works and the Shopify App Store page if you want to try it out.\n\nWish you the best!\n\n—Steve\n\n6,512 Views\n\n1\n\nLike\n\nReport\n\nReply\n\nIn response to Phteven # What alternatives to the Stocky app can improve inventory management?\n## \n*[Image: kingstore]*\n\nkingstore\n\nShopify Partner\n\n196\n5\n37\n\n* Mark as New\n\n* Bookmark\n\n* Subscribe\n\n* Mute\n\n* Subscribe to RSS Feed\n\n* Permalink\n\n* Print\n\n* Report Inappropriate Content\n\n‎05-23-2024\n07:05 PM\n\n@CloeG&nbsp;you can connect multiple Shopify stores into SKUSavvy and have these stores share a global inventory.

If you receive a batch of product at $5/unit but the previous batch was $6/unit, Shopventory will retain the $6 cost and dynamically switch to the $5 cost when the first batch has sold through, following FIFO (you can switch to LIFO or even use Average COGS).\n\nAgain, lots more to dig into but I hope this helps!

Can connect multiple Shopify stores to share global inventory\nPrediko\n: Mentioned positively for its “Buying table” feature\nCommon pain points discussed:\nStocky lacks customizable low inventory alerts (one user combines it with Stockbot as a workaround)\nNeed for better purchase order generation\nMulti-store inventory consolidation\nThe discussion remains open with multiple vendors offering solutions ranging from simple inventory counting tools to full WMS platforms.\nSummarized with AI on October 27.\nAI used: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929.\npratiksri\nSeptember 16, 2020,  9:15pm\n1\nWe have issues with the stocky app and question whether this is the only app and best way to receive inventory. We have huge problems reporting and recording inventory and invoices to our quick books accounting software. We have ruled out A2X app and others for instance. We are unsure we are reporting accurate cost of goods and need help analyzing the way we have set up our inventory intake  and use of Quick books accounting with this shopify pos system\n1 Like\njasonavada\nSeptember 17, 2020,  2:37am\n2\nHi there\n@pratiksri\nInventory management is vital to customer service since it enables you to avoid fault, such as letting customers order items out of stock. A good inventory management system will also allow you to keep track of production and backorders, so you can inform your customers of the time the product will be in stock. In case you are looking for an alternative to the Stocky app, kindly take a look at our list:\n32+ Best Shopify Inventory Management Apps\nand pick the most suitable app for your business.\nHope it helps!\nPhteven\nSeptember 17, 2020,  8:57pm\n3\nHello Pratiksri:\nWhile I can’t help you with the PO receiving and QuickBooks integration issues, I can suggest our\nCohub Inventory app\nfor improving the accuracy of your inventory quantities. Obviously, you need item quantities to be spot-on for subsequent value calculations to be reliable.\nWe include a smartphone app that makes stocktakes easier and less error prone, e.g. you can quickly scan barcodes with the phone’s built-in camera, no additional hardware required. You can even invite other smarthphone-wielding users to help with the inventory count.\nThe Cohub Inventory Admin on Shopify provides total inventory values by location so you should be able to compare those numbers with what you see in QuickBooks.\nAnd, we’ll soon release our\nTime Travel\nfeature that lets you see inventory values on any given day in the past, useful for tracking down where things may have gotten off track. I bet your financial folks and accountant will appreciate that.\nHere’s a\nquick video overview\nof how it works and the\nShopify App Store page\nif you want to try it out.\nWish you the best!\n—Steve\n1 Like\nShopventorySean\nSeptember 22, 2020,  4:52pm\n4\nHi there! Sean from the\nShopventory.com\nteam.\nWithout having a larger conversation about what you’re working on and the problems you’re running into, I think Shopventory may be a good “app” addition to your Shopify store.\nYou made a comment about cost management: Shopventory tracks COGS on a lot-by-lot basis. If you receive a batch of product at $5/unit but the previous batch was $6/unit, Shopventory will retain the $6 cost and dynamically switch to the $5 cost when the first batch has sold through, following FIFO (you can switch to LIFO or even use Average COGS).\nAgain, lots more to dig into but I hope this helps!

STOCKY is the best I have found so far and it’s free with a Shopify account but there’s one important thing it doesn’t do: Allow you to enter custom LOW INVENTORY ALERTS. Instead it tells me that every single item I have in inventory is LOW when I don’t care about half those products because they’re custom order items or things I don’t stock on shelf.\nThe perfect combination for me is STOCKY + STOCKBOT. Stockbot allows me to get custom low level item thresholds and disable specific products that I don’t want alerts for. Problem with Stockbot is that it doesn’t allow me to generate purchase orders. Why can’t Stocky allow me to disable certain products…?? ARGH!!!\n1 Like\nBundleSync\nFebruary 16, 2021,  5:41am\n6\nHey\nYou are 100% on the restock levels. We had to develop the option ourselves for a couple of clients as there is no field in Shopify for it so we set the levels in our system and then generate report based on when the stock drops below that level.\nRegards\nTom\nHorseCowboy\nMay 29, 2022,  4:54pm\n7\nI’ll toot my own horn here because my app\nHorse\nis probably the only application out there similar to Stock. It’s built exclusively for Shopify and does everything that Stocky can do, but better. It’s also not limited to just POS. I’d love to hear any feedback that you have about it!\nkingstore\nOctober 10, 2023,  1:13am\n8\nHey\n@pratiksri\n, you may have already found a new solution, although people searching this question should consider some of the new updates within Stocky, and if you are looking to upgrade to a full WMS then you should consider SKUSavvy.\nSKUSavvy is a\nlightweight WMS for Shopify\nthat will provide all the capabilities of Stocky in a single mobile accessible platform. You’d replace the following capabilities:\nInventory Sync:\nBoth platforms have direct stock sync with your Shopify inventory in near real-time\nProducts vendors and suppliers:\nwhat is currently held as a vendor to a product in Shopify will come over into SKUSavvy, so you’ll have vendor/product/cost available. Stocky currently uses supplier and vendor to organize this information.\nPurchase Orders\n: Purchase orders are created and managed in SKUSavvy with communication to your vendors built in. The PO process has workflows on each side to mark as delivered, count, and allocation.\nCheck-in:\nYour new inventory is brought into the warehouse through a mobile scannable check-in and digital view of where the inventory belongs on a map of your warehouse with easy scan and allocation in bulk\nInventory:\nManaged directly with SKUSavvy to visual bin locations. Use bin to bin replenishments and automated bin stocking to move inventory around. Create stock takes and remove inventory with reasoning similar to Stocky.\nTransfers:\nmoving stock between locations includes workflows for staff in the warehouse as well as creation of these movements directly in SKUSavvy\nThings SKUSavvy includes:\nFulfillment:\ndesigned to help you fulfill many orders quickly while keeping your whole inventory up to date across the pick-pack-ship process\nWarehouse Management:\nbuild your warehouses into a digital 3D model and store inventory as well as to have routed pick paths highlighted during fulfillment\nShipping:\nconnected directly with your carriers\nOrder Management:\nBring over orders and make edits directly within the platform\nFor many merchants Stocky will work great, for those of your needing something more on the warehouse management side that works perfectly with Shopify and will serve as a good replacement to Stocky check out\nSKUSavvy\nCloeG\nMay 21, 2024, 10:36pm\n9\nHi\n@kingstore\n, I would like to know if this app could solve the issue I have. I need all the products from my different stores (I have 3 stores) to merge into one inventory so that I only have to upload the products once. I have a good amount of products that are shared between my stores. Currently, I use stocky and upload my products through Shopify on each store.\nkingstore\nMay 23, 2024, 11:05pm\n10\n@CloeG\nyou can connect multiple Shopify stores into SKUSavvy and have these stores share a global inventory. This is an advanced feature that requires a implementation to connect the stores internet\ngauravj21sep\nJanuary 2, 2025, 12:44pm\n11\nWe have been using Prediko for the last 3 months and very happy with it. The Buying table is very useful. Helps with our job.\nkingstore\nJune 16, 2025,  4:17am\n12\nMaybe you’ve already chosen a Stocky replacement but if not I’d like to put SKUSavvy into the ring. It’s probably best suited as a replacement since it has all the capability of Stocky with the addition of more warehouse related features and of course detailed logs of every single action that happens in the warehouse. Logs include:\nComplete warehouse log\nOrder logs (purchase orders, outbound orders, transfers)\nEmployee logs\nbin logs\nSKU logs\nStock take logs\nBatch logs\nkingstore_0-1750047392545.png\n998×536 57.4 KB\nkingstore_1-1750047392692.png\n999×538 186 KB\nStock adjustments are easily done by scan, search, or simply tapping the quantity and can require a custom reason.
