If your ERP is on-prem, the usual approach is to expose the needed data via SQL or a secure API and then push it into monday using the\nmonday.com\nAPI. Tools like Zapier, Make, or a custom script can automate the weekly import and remove the manual work.\ndrtanvisachar\n(Dr. Tanvi Sachar- Certified Monday.com Partner)\nJanuary 7, 2026,  5:52pm\n5\nHello\n@JHolden1975\nHi! We ran into the same thing. There isn’t a built in Global Shop integration in monday, so we ended up using a middleware tool to bridge the two. In our case, pulling the data out of Global Shop and then pushing it into monday worked best and removed the manual updates.\nIf you’re just getting started, tools like Zapier or Make are usually the easiest path. If you need something more custom, monday’s API and webhooks give you a lot of flexibility.

Use a Connect boards column so each work order links to a client, then mirror the Status and Date columns back to the Clients board.\nAdd a Date Completed column that is set when a work order is marked Done, and a Scheduled Date for upcoming work.

Only users assigned to a record after its creation receive push notifications.\nAirtable's comments and threads are laughable. Maybe we were spoiled coming from Monday, but we just figured that Airtable would have taken the time to fine tune this feature that seems like a must have for any work management software. No ability to respond to threads in the mobile app. No file uploads to comments/updates. The list goes on and on.\nMobile app performance is poor, to put it mildly. There are significant bugs between IOS and Android versions. On the off chance that you do get a push notification and tap on the notification, you're taken to the parent record rather than being taken to the comment in which you were tagged.\nAnyone have any workarounds for these issues?\nWhat other software are you using that has great relational database capability with high quality front end tools for internal and external user interfaces and apps?\nI had such big plans for Airtable including creating personal productivity and organizational tools for myself, my wife, and our family.

Instead of overwriting, the import tool should support merging column values—especially for fields like Notes or Attendees. A smart merge (e.g. appending new data with a delimiter) would save hours of manual cleanup and preserve historical context. Definitely worth prioritizing as a feature request.\nBest Regards,\nJulie Batson\n1 Like\nmckenna_m\n(McKenna)\nJanuary 27, 2026,  7:04am\n4\nHey! Alfred’s solution is the right call for this if your attendee names match exactly between lists. I think that app handles the join/don’t overwrite problem well.\nOne edge case where you’d need something different is when the same person appears with name variations (‘John Smith’ vs ‘J. Smith’ vs. John A. Smith’). Monday’s deduplication won’t catch those since it relies on exact matching. For that scenario, you’d want to clean/merge the data before importing using a tool that can do fuzzy/semantic matching. (Full disclosure, this is what I work on, but if you have this issue, you can test it out free at:\nMerge - Join datasets with no matching key | everyrow\n). But if your names are consistent, stick with the native app since that would be simpler.

Consider adding exponential back off with increasing wait times before retries.\nInstead of handling files individually, try batching API requests where possible to optimize efficiency.\nImplement a job queue to track failed uploads and retry asynchronously instead of hitting the limit in quick succession.\nMonitor error codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests, 500 Server Errors) and log response headers to better understand the issue during review.\nSimulate a heavier API load to replicate the review environment and fine-tune your app accordingly.\nYuvrajSingh\n(Yuvraj Singh Rajput)\nMarch 13, 2025,  6:47am\n3\nHello\n@sachinkarma\nThanks for the response.\nmonday.com\nfile upload API do not support bulk file upload(see it\nhere\n), so we have to upload one file at a time.\nWe are also handling 429 status code requests and are retrying after the given value(present in retry-header\nhere\n) + 10seconds.\nRelated topics\nTopic\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\nExplanation of using api’s to manipulate files\nmonday apps & integrations\nintegrations\n18\n3162\nFebruary 25, 2021\nHandling 200+ file uploads in monday.com – anyone keen to test a small helper tool?\nmonday apps & integrations\nboards\n,\napps\n1\n15\nMay 16, 2025\nIssues with Limit using python api query\nSpecial workflows & use cases\napi\n,\nexport\n,\npython\n2\n58\nMarch 5, 2025\nFile Uploads Failing / Cancelling\nPlatform discussions\nboards\n,\nfiles\n1\n197\nAugust 11, 2024\nForm limits?\nmonday apps & integrations\nforms\n,\nboards\n,\nfiles\n,\nworkforms\n1\n105\nOctober 23, 2024\nHome\nCategories\nGuidelines\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nPowered by\nDiscourse\n, best viewed with JavaScript enabled\nBecome part\nof our community\ngroups\nReddit community\nView the community >\nGlobal Facebook community\nView the community >\nLocal Facebook communities\nView the community >\nDevelopers community\nView the community >\nNonprofit community\nView the community >\nCan't find what you're looking for?\nCan't find\nwhat you need?\nContact Support\nVisit the help center >\nPricing\nContact us\nTemplates\nSMB\nEnterprise\nNonprofits\nApps marketplace\n24/7\n                                    support\nFeatures\nDocs\nIntegrations\nAutomations\nAI\nDashboards\nKanban\nGantt\nmonday products\nmonday work management\nmonday CRM\nmonday dev\nmonday service\nBeta\nMore by monday.com\nWorkCanvas\nWorkForms\nUse cases\nMarketing\nProject management\nSales\nDevelopers\nHR\nIT\nOperations\nConstruction\nCompany\nAbout us\nCareers - We're hiring!\nInsights for leaders\nPress\nCustomer stories\nBecome a partner\nSustainability & ESG\nAffiliates\nEmergency Response\nInvestor relations\nResources\nHelp Center\nCommunity\nBlog\nWhat's new\nAcademy\nGlobal events\nmonday spaces\nStartup for startup\nApp development\nFind a partner\nHire an expert\nCompare\nSecurity\nTerms and\n                                    privacy\nPrivacy policy\nStatus\nAll Rights Reserved\n© monday.com\nAccessibility statement", "dedupe": "unique", "errors": []}

The text column updates. But the other three do not.\nThe two connect/relationship columns are simply being updated with the ID of a newly created item (a Contact, and an Account respectively) which the two prior modules handle.\nI am fairly certain it was working when I set the scenarios up in early August, and last tested (Aug 19th). I would have noticed if it was not. Nothing I am aware of has changed in the scenarios or on Monday since that time.\nI don’t believe it’s a permissions issue, as many other modules in the scenario are able to interact with Monday as per normal (creating new items, updating statuses, etc.).\nChatGPT suggested it was because the Monday API is expecting an array for the connect columns. So I modified the module to sent the itemID in an array. That didn’t help.\nWhat else should I be looking into or considering regarding this issue?\nThe input bundle (the data being passed to the Monday API) is:\n[\n    {\n        \"itemId\": \"2069891476\",\n        \"boardId\": \"2003597746\",\n        \"columnValuesToChange\": [\n            {\n                \"columnId\": \"board_relation_mkrqchz9\",\n                \"columnValue\": {\n                    \"item_ids\": 2069960031\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"columnId\": \"board_relation_mkrvcqbt\",\n                \"columnValue\": {\n                    \"item_ids\": 2069960022\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"columnId\": \"long_text_mkta2a14\",\n                \"columnValue\": {\n                    \"text\": \"2025-09-07 16:09:  Created New Contact. Linked it to an existing Account. Linked to Lead. (Branch 6)\"\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"create_labels_if_missing\": false\n    }\n]\nI see in\nthis post\nthe the OP ended up having to “execute GraphQL query”. Is that really necessary? Does the respective Monday module in Make really not handle Connect columns correctly, even after recognising the column type and providing a UI for mapping the data?\nAlso, one response to the OP suggested,\nYou should use the following: {“item_ids”:[1192506081]}\nBut that results in custom JSON embedded within the JSON the module outputs. E.g.\n\"columnId\": \"board_relation_mkrvcqbt\",\n                \"columnValue\": {\n                    \"item_ids\": \"{“item_ids”:[2069961483]}\"\n                }\ninspiredearth\n(Jonathan)\nSeptember 7, 2025,  9:25am\n2\nI’ve since discovered the Make module was working fine.\nThe issue is that when using the Monday API (via the Make modules) to update Connect columns, the data in my browser was not dynamically updating. I’d not come across that before. Normally my view of the data in the browser updates in front of me.\nIt was only showing the update after a page refresh.\nSo this is the issue, not the one I described in my post. I have now resolved this issue by changing the scenario configuration so that it creates the link from the other side. Meaning, when I create the Contact I use that module to link it to the Lead. Likewise when I create the Account.\nPreviously I was creating the Contact and Account, and then updating the Lead to connect to those new items.\nRelated topics\nTopic\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\nMake and Monday board integration\nmonday apps & integrations\nintegrations\n,\nautomations\n,\nboards\n0\n529\nFebruary 5, 2024\nMake.com \"get an item\" modules returning inconsistent data\nmonday apps & integrations\nautomations\n,\napi\n,\nmake\n0\n682\nNovember 13, 2023\nMultiperson column data structure - Make Intergration\nmonday apps & integrations\ncolumns\n,\nintegromat\n,\napi\n5\n399\nApril 8, 2024\nConnecting Items Between Monday.com Boards Created from Managed Templates Using Make.com\nPlatform discussions\nconnect-boards\n,\napi\n2\n43\nJanuary 20, 2025\nHi!

That’s how we see how much work is scheduled per day and what’s coming up in an easy chart format. Of course, that’s only available on the pro plan, which is a big jump in cost. We also need 4 seats instead of 3, which is another increase. We currently pay $684 per year. Three users right now, but we need 4 or 5.\nI’m looking for alternatives that look and work similarly, so there’s no steep learning curve. Ideally, I can train staff to use it within a day or so for the basics.\nI’m looking for something where all these VIEWS don’t cost extra and are included.\nI’m also looking for something that allows 4, 5, or even 6 users without additional cost.\nWe’ve also brought on two new staff members. They’re heading up a marketing campaign involving art, cold calls, email, and direct mail. This is our first time doing this since we’ve always relied on organic inbound sales. I need to assign them tasks for the next 365 days so they know exactly what to work on each day and can simply mark tasks complete without losing track or guessing. So each of them basically needs a task board.\nI’m also planning to focus on our 3,000 existing clients. I need a CRM, or at least a makeshift system, where I can keep everything in one dashboard and import all their contacts. From there, I want to update conversations, upcoming needs, set reminders, and log notes under each name after I call or email them. I do NOT need a sales pipeline. I only need TABLE and CHART VIEW, no calendar, no kanban, etc.\nIdeally, it would integrate with Mailchimp, Gmail, and QuickBooks, but that’s definitely not required.\nMOSTLY I JUST NEED IT TO BE WAY CHEAPER THAN WHAT I’M PAYING NOW.

I want to hear your honest opinions and experiences about Asana and Monday.I need it for my team of around 12 people (we will be 15 soon). Asana is great if you need structure and a clean UI, but it can get clunky when managing lots of cross-functional work. Monday is more visual and flexible, but sometimes that flexibility turns into chaos unless you’re strict about how you use it. But I have to give Monday the nod when trying to organize other things on top of tasks. For example, we have some physical tools that we need to keep track of, basically things like electrical testers and calibration equipment.", "source_domain": "www.reddit.com", "content": "Reddit - The heart of the internet\nSkip to main content\nOpen menu\nOpen navigation\nGo to Reddit Home\nr/software\nGet App\nGet the Reddit app\nLog In\nLog in to Reddit\nExpand user menu\nOpen settings menu\nGo to software\nr/software\n•\nCKarcz\nAsana vs Monday: what's the best project management tool in your opinion?\nThere are hundreds of review posts and videos online, none of them honest.

Here’s a succinct guide to help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each tool based on their feedback:\nAsana\nStrengths\n:\nStructured and Clear\n: Asana is praised for its structured approach and clarity in managing complex projects.\n\"Asana users often praise structure and clarity for complex projects\"\nTask Dependencies and Timelines\n: It excels in handling task dependencies, timelines, and reporting.\n\"Asana is very straightforward and intuitive, I feel.\"\nCross-Functional Work\n: Ideal for teams needing visibility and lightweight coordination across different functions.\n\"It earns its keep when you’re running cross functional work where visibility and lightweight coordination matter more than true portfolio control.\"\nRemote Team Support\n: Works well for remote teams due to its online nature.\n\"The company I’m in is fully remote, and it works well for those teams who rely on it.\"\nWeaknesses\n:\nAutomation Limits\n: Asana’s automation capabilities can be limiting for complex workflows.\n\"You'll run into automation limits\"\nCRM Integration\n: Not ideal for CRM purposes, although it can be adapted.\n\"We use Asana but it's not a CRM, it's a project management tool\"\nPricing\n: The paid version is necessary for full functionality, and the cost can be a deterrent for small teams.\n\"If you use the free version then no. If you get the paid version yes.\"\nMonday.com\nStrengths\n:\nCustomization and Visual Workflows\n: Users appreciate its flexibility and visual appeal.\n\"Monday users love customization and visual workflows\"\nDashboards and Reporting\n: Offers robust dashboards and reporting capabilities.\n\"Their dashboards and reporting are good.\"\nIntegrations\n: Excellent for integrations with other tools like Salesforce and Outlook.\n\"The integration with SFDC is great, as well as Outlook.\"\nMid-Sized Companies\n: Particularly useful for companies with 20-200 employees.\n\"The ROI sweet spot is honestly 20-200 person companies doing cross functional work.\"\nWeaknesses\n:\nComplexity\n: Can be overwhelming and complex for some users.\n\"Monday is very colourful and visually appealing. I did find the subtask creation process slightly convoluted there.\"\nSubtask Limitations\n: Lacks advanced subtask management and dependencies.\n\"You can't have dependencies between tasks and subtasks - never mind between tasks in different projects\"\nPricing\n: Higher-tier features like chart view are behind a paywall.\n\"The main issue is we need the CHART VIEW. That’s how we see how much work is scheduled per day and what’s coming up in an easy chart format. Of course, that’s only available on the pro plan, which is a big jump in cost.\"\nConclusion\nChoose Asana if\n: You need a structured, straightforward tool for complex project management and cross-functional work.\nChoose Monday.com if\n: You prefer a highly customizable, visually appealing tool with strong dashboards and integrations.\nSubreddits for Further Questions\nr/projectmanagement\nr/Asana\nr/mondaydotcom\nThese communities can provide more personalized advice and help you make the best decision for your team.\nSee Answer\nAsana vs Monday pricing details\nBest project management tools for teams\nTrello vs Monday vs Asana comparison\nClickUp features compared to Asana\nNew to Reddit?\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our\nUser Agreement\nand acknowledge that you understand the\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nPublic\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n0\n0\nTop Posts\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of May 12, 2025\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of May 2025\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2025\nReddit Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nUser Agreement\nAccessibility\nReddit, Inc. © 2026.

Also depending on your team structure ,you should have a look at Krock.io if your organization handles a lot of creative or content based work. It’s built more for visual collaboration but integrates well into broader PM workflows. Monday is easier to use for less technical users on basic projects. Some of the rules and integrations on Monday are simpler to get running too. We have an app - Visor - which has a bi-directional Asana integration, and this is one of the main reasons people use Visor, as a layer on top of Asana because it gives them more capabilities to view groups of projects by all these different angles/groupings. So if you want to get those high-level views of multiple projects AND the ability to take a high-level view from multiple angles you'll need to use an Asana-integrated app, like Visor - should say for complete transparency there are other apps you can use with Asana for this too.", "source_domain": "www.reddit.com", "content": "Reddit - The heart of the internet\nSkip to main content\nOpen menu\nOpen navigation\nGo to Reddit Home\nr/Asana\nGet App\nGet the Reddit app\nLog In\nLog in to Reddit\nExpand user menu\nOpen settings menu\nGo to Asana\nr/Asana\n•\nPhysical-Selection10\nAsana vs Monday vs ClickUp - PM Software Needed for Professional Org\nI'm leading a project to select a new project management software for my organization.

As a NFP, we have strict guidelines on where the data can be stored.\nI am quite versed with Power Platform, as we have a lot of MS Forms connected to SP List or Power Apps for internal forms with everything connected to Power BI and Approvals.\nWe are digitising one of the forms where we need to get the e-signature in the form and it has to be anonymous so the public can use. Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn’t offer that feature nor I doubt they ever will.\nWe started exploring\nMonday.com\nForms and the idea of collecting info but passing it to Power Automate to store and actioning the responses sounded great.\nOnce again, Power Automate integration is not natively offered and the add-on by a third-party developer is so bloody expensive for what it does. I doubt\nMonday.com\ndev team will ever introduce this feature natively as they don’t want to upset their third-party developers contributing and making money off it.\nSo I went down the API route.\nThere is very little information on this and the limited forum posts are not explaining things clearly for beginners. So I decided to help all.\nMy setup: Public submits the form. I have one automation in\nMonday.com\nto call a webhook to pass the data to Power Automate. The flow will process the response, store it in a SP list, generate the PDF, email the responder from our system and also, delete the item from\nMonday.com\nso the data is not stored internationally.\nSteps:\nCreate the form in\nMonday.com\n.\nEnable Developer mode in the Monday Labs so you can easily get the column IDs.\nCreate a Power Automate Flow with “When a HTTP request is received” as the trigger and set the “Who can trigger the flow” to anyone. Unfortunately, this action and HTTP actions required for the rest of the automation need Power Automate Premium licence.\nCreate a test compose and put the body of the request there, and save.\nOnce you save the flow, it will generate the HTTP Post URL.\nGo to\nMonday.com\n, create an Automate to call Webhook when an item is created and put the URL there.\nWe need to create a Response action back to\nMonday.com\nso we can close the loop.\nimage\n622×344 8.33 KB\nHere, I added a 5-second delay (optional) in parallel for the files to be uploaded successfully.\nSubmit the form and go to the flow run history to get the body of the HTTP and copy it.\nCreate an action to Parse JSON, Generate from sample and paste the JSON to create the sample.\nYou can now create an SP item and use the values from the Parse JSON body. Ensure you follow the proper format as many columns have multiple attributes.\nExample: Dropdown will give the ID and the name; Email will give the text and email.\n(Optional) If you have files, the JSON will only return the Asset ID. In order to get the actual file, you need to send an HTTP request to the\nMonday.com\nAPI.\nTo keep it generic and reusable, I created a Select action to select the Asset ID. Then, a condition to check if the length is more than 0 (you can also use an empty function here).\nIf so, I join the Asset IDs with a comma and then send the IDs in the body.\nScreenshot 2025-12-12 140848\n614×801 17.9 KB\nYou need to send your API key in the header. You can get it from your\nMonday.com\naccount (\nmonday.com: Where Teams Get Work Done\n). Same as the previous HTTP body, run the flow, get the body and edit the flow to Parse JSON using the example.\nThe HTTP will give two attributes - Public URL and then the name.\nThe Public URL is where the file is. I then apply for each asset, send an HTTP request to get the file from the Public URL and append to my varAttachment array.\nimage\n649×734 18.3 KB\nYou can then add the attachments in an apply to each array value.\nPS: It is best to convert the file content to base64 and then back to binary when saving in an array.\nimage\n693×644 22.5 KB\nDeleting an item from the\nMonday.com\nboard:\nSend an HTTP POST request using your API key and pass the pulse ID to delete the item.\nScreenshot 2025-12-12 142334\n650×667 13.5 KB\nI hope this helps.

As the title says, we’re implementing a Transaction log table that records all inputs in our custom app.\nWe have two custom apps built with ReactJS. The first app is an\nItem View\nfeature that contains a form for collecting user input. The second app is an\nAccount Settings View\nfeature that manages credentials and request payloads used by the Item View.\nWhen a form is submitted from the Item View, it sends an HTTP REST API request to our backend application, which is also hosted in\nmonday.com\nusing server-side code.\nOur goal is to maintain a\ntransaction log tables\nfor every form submission coming from both the Item View and the Account Settings View. Each form should have its own corresponding table of records. The transaction logs table will be part of our App when it is installed.\nWhat do you think is the best practice for implementing this? Below is our idea we think are best so far:\nCreate a new\nBoard View\nthat aggregates two tables using the\nmonday.com\nGraphQL API. This is currently our preferred option. However, the challenge is that the app is not yet installed initially, so the tables are not created beforehand. Is there a way to automatically generate these tables when the app is installed?\nWould love hear other ideas for this approach.

The goal was to structure the folders like this:\nClient Name / Deal / File / file.docx\nEverything was working great until we encountered two common edge cases:\nWhen a\nnew item is created for an already existing client\n, and\nWhen\nmultiple items have the same client name\n(which would cause folder duplication errors in OneDrive).\nTo handle these scenarios smoothly, we implemented\nerror handlers in\nMake.com\n. The logic was:\nBefore creating a new folder,\nMake.com\nchecks if a folder with the client’s name already exists.\nIf it does, we\nresume the scenario\nwithout creating a duplicate and continue with the rest of the operations.\nThis ensures all deals for the same client are organized under a single parent folder without breaking the automation.\nThis approach has really helped us keep our folder structure clean and avoid failed runs due to duplication errors.\nHappy to share more details if anyone’s trying to do something similar or has other ideas to improve this flow!\nI have attached screenshots to explain the flow\nimage\n700×473 33.1 KB\nimage\n583×355 19.9 KB\n1 Like\ndvdsmpsn\n(David @ David Simpson Apps)\nApril 8, 2025, 12:48pm\n2\nHi\n@Timothy7\nJust to let you know, this sort of thing is\njust a small part\nof the out-of-the-box functionality for\nSharePoint\nin our\nMicrosoft 365 SharePoint  integration for monday.com\n, which is available on the marketplace:\nmonday.com\nMicrosoft 365 SharePoint • Automate & Embed - monday.com Marketplace\nSharePoint Automations.

For example, a folder with name “item 1” is present in OneDrive and if we try to create a folder with the same name then the new folder will automatically renamed to “Item 1 1”.\nIf you want to learn more about the app, please\nschedule a demo\n.\nTimothy7\n(Timothy Kariuki | CreativeBits LLC)\nApril 22, 2025, 10:04am\n4\nThank you for the insights I will have a look at it\nTimothy7\n(Timothy Kariuki | CreativeBits LLC)\nApril 22, 2025, 10:07am\n5\nThank you\n@YuvrajSingh\nlet me have a look at the app then get back to you\n1 Like\nRelated topics\nTopic\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\n🚀 Exciting News!

The core issue is that your automation’s trigger is likely being re-triggered by the action it takes, creating that endless cycle.\nHere’s a breakdown of the problem and how to fix it:\nUnderstanding the Loop\nTrigger: Your automation is triggered when an item is created or changed (likely based on the “Yes” responses in your form).\nAction: The automation duplicates the item and moves it to a different group.\nRe-trigger: The act of moving the duplicated item to a new group causes the automation to trigger again, because the item has been changed.\nRepeat: This cycle continues indefinitely.\nSpecialProjects\n(Shelbey Savoie)\nMarch 4, 2025, 12:27pm\n4\nHi!

If a MATCH is found, the connect board column connects to the original item on the board & identifies the the item just created as a DUPLICATE via a Formula Column.\nI’ve used the below on my board in the Formula Column:\nIF({*Deal Duplicated Detector#Count}>0,“Duplicated Deal”,“-”)\nAgain, you can substitute “Duplicated Deal” to display whatever message/warning you like. You can also add conditional colouring to any item which has “Duplicated Deal” as a return value.\nAs per below, the second item has been entered with a Deal # which already exists in the board, the match automation has connect the new item to the original entry & the formula has identified that the connect column is not empty and displayed our desired message. I also have a dedicated view “Duplicates” so it’s easy to monitor.\nimage\n1243×405 38.9 KB\nCouple of things to note, the match automation will only connect to the first matching item on the board & the match value is case sensitive, email can be tricky if some come through in upper case and others in lower, or a combination of both! I’d suggest using a Phone column if possible to prevent this.\nI hope you find this helpful.\nCheers.\nKyle.\nRelated topics\nTopic\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\nCheck for duplicates in a board while adding a new item\nPlatform discussions\nautomations\n,\nboards\n4\n593\nAugust 25, 2025\nCheck for Duplicate Items\nPlatform discussions\nautomations\n,\nconnect-boards\n,\nboards\n8\n14018\nAugust 11, 2024\nCheckin for duplicate entries in email column\nPlatform discussions\nautomations\n,\ncolumns\n,\nworkforms\n5\n900\nNovember 2, 2023\nHighlight and automation to detect a duplicate in a given line/column\nFeature requests\nautomations\n,\ncolumns\n,\nduplication\n,\nrecipe\n1\n56\nNovember 24, 2024\nPrevent duplicate item\nPlatform discussions\nduplication\n14\n17605\nDecember 21, 2021\nHome\nCategories\nGuidelines\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nPowered by\nDiscourse\n, best viewed with JavaScript enabled\nBecome part\nof our community\ngroups\nReddit community\nView the community >\nGlobal Facebook community\nView the community >\nLocal Facebook communities\nView the community >\nDevelopers community\nView the community >\nNonprofit community\nView the community >\nCan't find what you're looking for?\nCan't find\nwhat you need?\nContact Support\nVisit the help center >\nPricing\nContact us\nTemplates\nSMB\nEnterprise\nNonprofits\nApps marketplace\n24/7\n                                    support\nFeatures\nDocs\nIntegrations\nAutomations\nAI\nDashboards\nKanban\nGantt\nmonday products\nmonday work management\nmonday CRM\nmonday dev\nmonday service\nBeta\nMore by monday.com\nWorkCanvas\nWorkForms\nUse cases\nMarketing\nProject management\nSales\nDevelopers\nHR\nIT\nOperations\nConstruction\nCompany\nAbout us\nCareers - We're hiring!\nInsights for leaders\nPress\nCustomer stories\nBecome a partner\nSustainability & ESG\nAffiliates\nEmergency Response\nInvestor relations\nResources\nHelp Center\nCommunity\nBlog\nWhat's new\nAcademy\nGlobal events\nmonday spaces\nStartup for startup\nApp development\nFind a partner\nHire an expert\nCompare\nSecurity\nTerms and\n                                    privacy\nPrivacy policy\nStatus\nAll Rights Reserved\n© monday.com\nAccessibility statement", "dedupe": "unique", "errors": []}

I tried to use duplicate item in other boards, but the part I am stuck on is the mirror.\nWhen I use the mirror function, it still has me manually connect it in the other board. Is there a way to automatically have that filled in?\n1 Like\nLKat\n(Laura Katterhenry)\nApril 7, 2025, 10:28pm\n2\nSo you can definitely set up a series of automations that will automatically link your boards together. For example, if Source is your board 1 with the form, then Board 2 and Board 3 are your other boards you’d like to connect, you can use this recipe:\nWhen an item is created, create an item in Board 2 and connect Board 2 with Source, and create an item in Board 3 and connect Board 3 with Source.\nThis will then automatically connect all 3 boards with this new item that was created in your Source board. Then, in Boards 2 and 3, you can add mirror columns to show any/all columns from the original item in the Source board. Then, whenever any of the columns that are mirrored change in any of the boards, they will all change.\n4 Likes\nMykola\n(Mykola Pustovoychenko)\nApril 8, 2025, 11:34am\n3\nHi\n@BTindall\nThe answer of Laura is the classic way of connecting items between multiple boards, and if you don’t need to do a true duplication of all values, and just see those in mirror columns, then this is the easiest method by far.\nIf you need a full duplication of all values, and more complex synchronization options, consider\nresynced.io\napp:\nhttps://monday.com/marketplace/listing/10000688/resyncedio\nHere’s a step-by-step guide about how to do a sync between boards, and even between different\nmonday.com\naccounts:\nhttps://youtu.be/L5QV3eORaH4\nHope it helps.\nRelated topics\nTopic\nReplies\nViews\nActivity\nItem status in 2 boards\nPlatform discussions\nautomations\n,\nrecipe\n3\n34\nNovember 17, 2024\nCreate a new item and instantly duplicate and mirror it in a new board\nSpecial workflows & use cases\nautomations\n,\nmirror\n17\n32247\nMay 19, 2021\nAutomation to duplicate an item to a board then linking the boards (to retain subitems + updates)\nFeature requests\nautomations\n,\ncolumns\n,\nconnect-boards\n,\nboards\n,\nitem\n,\nduplication\n4\n794\nOctober 13, 2024\nAutomatically copying/syncing value of a column, from one board to another board\nPlatform discussions\nintegrations\n,\nautomations\n,\ncolumns\n,\nboards\n5\n3409\nDecember 21, 2023\nCreate an item in a different board and connect to two boards?\nSpecial workflows & use cases\nautomations\n,\nconnect-boards\n3\n679\nApril 30, 2024\nHome\nCategories\nGuidelines\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nPowered by\nDiscourse\n, best viewed with JavaScript enabled\nBecome part\nof our community\ngroups\nReddit community\nView the community >\nGlobal Facebook community\nView the community >\nLocal Facebook communities\nView the community >\nDevelopers community\nView the community >\nNonprofit community\nView the community >\nCan't find what you're looking for?\nCan't find\nwhat you need?\nContact Support\nVisit the help center >\nPricing\nContact us\nTemplates\nSMB\nEnterprise\nNonprofits\nApps marketplace\n24/7\n                                    support\nFeatures\nDocs\nIntegrations\nAutomations\nAI\nDashboards\nKanban\nGantt\nmonday products\nmonday work management\nmonday CRM\nmonday dev\nmonday service\nBeta\nMore by monday.com\nWorkCanvas\nWorkForms\nUse cases\nMarketing\nProject management\nSales\nDevelopers\nHR\nIT\nOperations\nConstruction\nCompany\nAbout us\nCareers - We're hiring!\nInsights for leaders\nPress\nCustomer stories\nBecome a partner\nSustainability & ESG\nAffiliates\nEmergency Response\nInvestor relations\nResources\nHelp Center\nCommunity\nBlog\nWhat's new\nAcademy\nGlobal events\nmonday spaces\nStartup for startup\nApp development\nFind a partner\nHire an expert\nCompare\nSecurity\nTerms and\n                                    privacy\nPrivacy policy\nStatus\nAll Rights Reserved\n© monday.com\nAccessibility statement", "dedupe": "unique", "errors": []}

Based on what you describe, you could either: create a slack command to manually prompt a form from your booking channel and update a deal record as needed · For example, we have a slack channel linked with booking tool, in the slack channel we will receive anything in regard to the booking/cancellation/rescheduling. However, on HubSpot, we cannot auto update the property of the \"consult date\" based on updates from slack channel, the contact property only keep track of the initial response in the form submission.

You cannot reliably push HubSpot Sales‑extension “email open” notifications to Slack, because HubSpot doesn’t expose these events via API or webhook. Workarounds include tracking clicks/replies instead, using an external custom tracking system, or switching to a tool that supports Slack notifications for opens. I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to send HubSpot’s email open notifications (the ones triggered by the tracking pixel when someone opens a tracked email sent via the HubSpot Sales Chrome extension) to a Slack channel. My boss relies heavily on those in-app notifications inside HubSpot (the ones that show up under the bell icon), and he wants those same “email opened” alerts to appear in Slack for specific leads or important deals. The problem is that HubSpot does NOT allow “email opens” to be used as triggers in Workflows, so you can’t natively automate anything based on those events. You're hitting the right wall—HubSpot doesn't expose Sales extension \"email open\" events as API webhooks or workflow triggers, which makes direct automation impossible. But here's the workaround that actually works: Instead of triggering off opens, trigger off engagement sequences that email opens create. When someone opens an email, they're usually about to reply or click. Set up a workflow that triggers on email click or reply instead, then send a custom Slack webhook payload with contact details. Most teams we've seen using this pattern get Slack alerts within 30-45 seconds of actual engagement, which is close enough to real-time for sales processes and catches the hot moments when prospects are actively reading.
